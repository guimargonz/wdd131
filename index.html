            <div class="personal-info">
                <p>My name is Guilherme, but most people call me Gui. I was born in Brazil and currently work as an IT Support Assistant at a drugstore chain. I live with my wonderful wife and our three beloved cats, who bring a lot of joy to our lives. In my free time, I love immersing myself in movies, series, and animes, as well as playing video games and engaging in RPGs. These hobbies are a great way for me to unwind and enjoy my leisure time.</p>
